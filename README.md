# Scary-House

Scary house is a very simple console game built with C# and Unity.

## Getting Started

Open Unity project and press play.

## Introduction to the game

You find yourself in a small closet which isn't as bad as it sounds as you are pretty short. But, as cosy as the closet is, you'd rather be outside with your lumberjack friends. You're quest is to make your way outside, but beware: whoever put you in the closet doesn't want you to get out and cut down trees, eat your lunch, or go to the lavatory.
