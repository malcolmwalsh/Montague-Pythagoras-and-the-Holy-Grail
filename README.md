# Scary-House
Scary house is a very simple console game built with C# and Unity.

## Getting Started
Open Unity project and press play, or, use the executable here (TODO: LINK TO RELEASES)

## Introduction to the game
You find yourself in a small closet which isn't as bad as it sounds as you are vertically challenged and basically pretty pathetic. But, as cosy as the closet is, you'd rather be outside with your lumberjack friends. Youe quest is to make your way outside, but beware: whoever put you in the closet doesn't want you to get out. They don't want you to cut down trees, or eat your lunch, or go to the lavatory.

## Instructions
All controls use the keyboard.

* At the Main Menu, press:

  - `N` for a new game
  - `H` for in-game help
  - `Esc` to snuff it (quit).  

* Within the game, press:

  - `W`, `S`, `A`, and `D` to move North, South, West and East respectively
  - `I` to inspect the room you're in
  - `H` for help
  - `Esc` to bravely run away to the Main Menu.
  
* In dialogue, press:
  - `1`, `2` or `3` to choose the response from the options provided

## Licence
You can play if you promise not to tell Monty Python that I've stolen all their jokes.
